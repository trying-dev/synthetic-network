# Synthetic network setup
#
# Expects to run in a privileged docker container and the environment variable
# SYNTHETIC_NETWORK to be set to the subnet of the synthetic network. The
# container must be connected to that network.
#
# Example:
#  $ export SYNTHETIC_NETWORK=10.77.0.0/16
#  $ docker network create synthetic-network --subnet=$SYNTHETIC_NETWORK
#  $ docker create --privileged --env SYNTHETIC_NETWORK --name test <image>
#  $ docker network connect synthetic-network test
#
# Here, we take over the interface to the synthetic network and install a
# userspace proxy to shape the traffic. The application to be tested will use
# this conditioned interface (via a default route), and hence use the synthetic
# network. Services that we wish to remain uninterrupted (REST API to control
# the synthetic network, Chrome headless remote port, ...) will still listen on
# the default network.
#

# Fall back to using default network
if [ -z $SYNTHETIC_NETWORK ]; then

# Create a new veth pair veth0<->veth0s
# We will bridge $dev<->veth0:
#  - $dev is the container’s interface on the synthetic network
#  - userspace packet processing program forwards packets
#    between $dev and veth0
#  - the application to be tested will use veth0s for all its networking
#   (because we will install a default route that tells it to)
ip link add veth0 type veth peer name veth0s

# Bring veth0 up

# Configure our synthetic interface (veth0s)
# We assign the container’s IP address on the synthetic network to veth0s, and
# direct the container’s default route to go over veth0s as well so that the
# application to be tested defaults to the synthetic network
